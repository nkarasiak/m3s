  - Neighbor finding operations cached to avoid repeated computation
  - UTM zone calculations cached with coordinate rounding for efficiency

### Enhanced
- **Parallel Processing Engine**: Memory-aware enhancements
  - Added `optimize_memory` and `adaptive_chunking` configuration options

  - Fixed GPU fallback test failures with proper mock handling
  - Added proper import fallbacks for missing Dask/GPU dependencies

  - `psutil` made optional with fallback implementations for memory monitoring
  - All memory features work without optional dependencies installed
  - Proper warnings when advanced features are unavailable

### Performance
- **Significant Memory Reduction**: Optimized memory usage for large datasets
  - Lazy evaluation prevents unnecessary data loading
  - Automatic garbage collection during processing
  - Memory pressure monitoring with adaptive responses
- **Caching Performance**: Substantial speedup for repeated operations
  - Coordinate-based operations benefit from spatial caching
  - Area calculations cached to avoid repeated expensive projections
  - Neighbor queries cached for common access patterns
- **Streaming Efficiency**: Process datasets larger than available memory
  - Chunked processing with automatic size optimization
  - Memory-aware fallbacks for problematic data chunks
  - Streaming iterators for minimal memory footprint

### Technical
- **New Modules**: Added two major new modules

  - `test_csquares.py` - 21 tests bringing CSquares to 98% coverage
  - All parallel processing tests now pass (27/27)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-21

### Added
- **New Grid Systems**: Expanded from 3 to 6 spatial grid systems
  - `QuadkeyGrid` - Microsoft Bing Maps quadtree-based square tiles (levels 1-23)
  - `S2Grid` - Google's spherical geometry cells using Hilbert curve (levels 0-30)
  - `SlippyGrid` - Standard web map tiles (z/x/y format) used by OpenStreetMap (zoom 0-22)
- **Grid Area Properties**: All grid systems now support `area_km2` property
  - Returns theoretical area in square kilometers for cells at specified precision/resolution/level
  - Example: `H3Grid(7).area_km2` returns 5.16 km²
- **Parallel Processing Engine**: Comprehensive distributed computing support
  - `ParallelGridEngine` with Dask, GPU (RAPIDS), and threading backends
  - Stream processing capabilities for large datasets
  - Automatic fallbacks when specialized libraries are unavailable
- **Enhanced Examples**: Updated visualization examples

  - Area calculations and grid characteristics documentation

### Changed
- **S2 Grid Implementation**: Completely rewritten S2 implementation
  - Removed fallback implementation in favor of proper `s2sphere` library integration
  - Made `s2sphere>=0.2.5` a required dependency (was optional)
  - Fixed cell generation issues where no tiles were found
- **Example Visualizations**: Updated to 3×2 subplot layout to accommodate 6 grid systems
- **Dependencies**: Added `s2sphere>=0.2.5` as required dependency

### Fixed
- S2 grid cell generation now works correctly with proper s2sphere integration
- Fixed coordinate conversion issues in S2 implementation
