## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-20

### Added
- **UTM Zone Integration**: All grid systems now include UTM zone information
  - `utm` column in `intersect_geodataframe()` results containing EPSG codes
  - MGRS: UTM zone extracted directly from MGRS identifier
  - Geohash: UTM zone calculated from cell centroid coordinates
  - H3: UTM zone calculated from hexagon centroid coordinates
  - Automatic handling of special UTM cases (Norway, Svalbard)

### Changed  
- Updated documentation to focus on core spatial functionality
- Simplified package description and removed hierarchical references

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-20

### Added
- **GeoPandas Integration**: Native support for GeoDataFrames with automatic CRS transformation
  - `intersect_geodataframe()` method for all grid systems
  - `intersect_geodataframe_aggregated()` method for unique cell analysis
  - Automatic coordinate reference system (CRS) handling
  - Preserves original GeoDataFrame data and attributes
- H3 (Uber's Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index) grid system support
  - Resolution levels 0-15 with hexagonal cells
  - Hierarchical operations (parent/children relationships)
  - Compact/uncompact operations for optimization
  - Neighbor finding (always 6 neighbors for hexagons)
  - Global uniform coverage with minimal distortion
- MGRS precision 0 support for 100km Ã— 100km grid squares  
- Comprehensive precision documentation with detailed tables
- Performance and selection guidelines for choosing grid systems
- Equivalent precision mapping between all grid systems

### Changed
